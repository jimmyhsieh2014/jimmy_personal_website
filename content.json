        "description": "In Taiwanese folklore, burning paper items can transmit objects to deceased relatives, allowing them to live eternally together. Origami, beyond its religious functions, strengthens familial bonds and heals sorrow. Conversely, as memory declines, recognizing people becomes harder, and familiar faces may fade away, akin to the 'goldfish brain' phenomenon. This work prints photos of the artist from childhood to adulthood on paper money, compiling them into a photo book. Viewers tear out pages, fold them into fish, and burn them, symbolizing the fading memory of loved ones. The burning fish carry the artist's image to the other side, aiming for eternal remembrance.",

        "description": "The piece captures public telephones within the author's urban environment, documenting the GPS coordinates of each one. As communication technology evolves, public telephones have become overlooked objects. The author seeks to empathize with those who have lost access to communication devices like mobile phones, exploring the sentiment of searching for communication lifelines in the city. By locating these disappearing public telephones, they ultimately create a survival map of urban communication spots.",

Unlike face-to-face conversations, online chats often lack continuity, leading to communication breakdowns without facial cues. Created by authors from Taiwan(Yu-Lin Tsai) and Switzerland(Yi-Kai Chen), the book documents a month-long exchange solely through photos. Viewers decide the conversation's pace, achieving a unique asynchronous communication experience.",

It presents a series of images with multiple layers of contrast. Ultimately, it is presented in the form of a double-sided photography book, printed on fragile paper, ensuring that the book gradually deteriorates during its exhibition as viewers flip through its pages.",
